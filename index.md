# About

*Survive the Century* is a branching narrative game about the political, environmental and social choices humans will face between 2021 and 2100 as we adapt to the ravages of climate change.

This game is a work of fiction, but it is informed by real science.

We hope that this game helps you to feel less hopeless and nihilistic about the future. Our choices matter. It’s not over. There are still a lot of decisions we can make that will lead to dramatically different futures.
