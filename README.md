# Survive the Century

Built with the [Electric Book](http://electricbook.works).

Survive the Century is a branching narrative game about the political, environmental and social choices the human race will face between 2021-2100 as we adapt to the ravages of climate change. 

The point of the game is that our choices matter, it’s not over, and there are still a lot of decisions we can make that will lead to dramatically different futures.

## Game summary

You are playing the news editor of the world’s most prominent news organization over the remainder of the 21st century (2021 to 2100). You get to pick the angle on the news, and thereby influence public sentiment, leading to different political decisions: will rich countries accept the increasing waves of climate refugees into their countries? Can the world agree to stop burning fossil fuels in time, or will a maverick cabal of billionaires be left to deploy a fleet of space-mirrors in a last-minute attempt to stop the temperature from rising?

Along the way, you get to read short articles that give life and detail to the decisions you’ve made, for example, you might get to read an interview with an Ecofeminist Activist in Nigeria in 2068, or read the speech in which the president of Indonesia in 2082 declares war on Vietnam over dwindling fish reserves in the region (a “flash war” that is concluded in under 2 minutes via AI), or play a Buzzfeed-style “which extinct animal species matches your personality?” quiz in 2091. These articles were written by prominent science fiction writers from around the world.

There’s a real scientific climate change model behind the game (built on an existing modeling tool called [En-Roads](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html)) that predicts the final temperature at the end of the century. There are feedback loops built into the game: the higher temperature rises, the more disaster events start to happen, which themselves have political and economic consequences. We’re also working with a number of prominent climate and social scientists to ensure that players can click through to read about the science underpinning the stories.

The game is designed to be played in 30 minutes, and to be engaging and funny enough that players will want to share it with others. We hope that players would be more likely to contribute to combating climate change if they can visualize how their actions would make an impact. They would leave the game with a visceral sense of how actions taken today can produce a variety of different climate-change impacted worlds tomorrow.

After completing the game, the player will be encouraged to join a local climate justice / action group to continue to learn and take action.

## Who's making this?

The lead author of this project is me, [Sam Beckbessinger](https://sambeckbessinger.com/). I’m a South African writer now based in the UK. I wrote the main storylines of the game, and I’ll also be your main point of contact for the project.

The other two project leads are [Simon Nicholson](https://www.american.edu/sis/faculty/snichols.cfm) and [Christopher Trisos](https://climaterisklab.com/team/). They’re both world-leading climate impact academics, and fellows of the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center at University of Maryland, which brings scientists and artists of different disciplines together to think about the intersections between climate change and social change.

The original idea for the game came out of a workshop Simon and Chris facilitated which brought together SF writers (including myself, Lauren Beukes and Mohale Mashigo) with climate scientists and experts including climate modelers, social scientists and geoengineering specialists, all of whom contributed ideas that are present in the game.

[Annika Brandow](http://annikabrandow.com/) and [Karen Lilje](https://www.hybridcreative.co.za/about) are leading the visual identity of the project, and [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks.com/) is our web development and publishing partner.

This is a not-for-profit project, and our goal is to increase public literacy about climate change. Survive the Century will be free to play and share.

## Project goals
- Improve understanding of how climate change might impact our lives over the coming century, amongst ordinary people.
- Combat hopelessness! Our choices still matter. They will continue to matter. We need to be able to imagine positive futures, not just bleak ones. Every 0.1 of a degree matters.
- Show that "easy fix' solutions are not easy.
- Lead players to join climate justice groups.
- Help players understand how our broad social systems interact with the climate, and vice versa.

## The main storylines
There are five main storylines that act as "highways" through the game, with plenty of back-alleys that branch off and between them.

1. **Ecosocialist Utopia**: a decolonized hippie vegan socialist utopia.
2. **Slow Fade**: procrastinate until it's too late.
3. **Climate Wars**: tensions over the changing climate lead to WWIII.
4. **Billionaire Saviours**: billionaires use the climate emergency to steal the world.
5. **Designer Planet**: abandon nature and embrace a fully technological future.

Players will be able to hop between different storylines as they play (they might start off on an Ecosocialist path, but then make TERRIBLE DECISIONS and end up in the Climate Wars timeline; or start out relying on billionaires to save us, but later decide that democracy is better). There will also be opportunities for surprise along particular storylines as disasters occur, societies tip suddenly into new ways of being and understanding, or climate impacts turn out to be better or worse than anticipated. Players can also replay the story as many times as they like.
