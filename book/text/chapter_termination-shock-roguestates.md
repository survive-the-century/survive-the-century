Yeah… that doesn’t work.

The rogue states successfully hack the space mirrors and bring down the whole system.

It turns out that we’d become more dependent on geoengineering than we realized. As soon as we stop, the temperature shoots up very suddenly.

> One of the potential risks of blocking some of the sun’s rays to offset global warming is that if we stopped, the temperature could rise very quickly. This would happen if geoengineering was deployed without society also reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. Suddenly stopping geoengineering would cause temperatures to rebound fast. Scientists call this risk "termination shock" and it would be catastrophic for ecosystems globally.
