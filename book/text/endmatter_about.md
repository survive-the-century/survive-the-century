# About

*Survive the Century* grew out of a workshop convened in 2019 by **Dr. Christopher Trisos** and associate professor **Dr. Simon Nicholson**, climate researchers at the University of Cape Town and American University, respectively. This workshop, under the umbrella of the US-based National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Centre (SESYNC), brought together people from different backgrounds from around the world to think about the climate emergency. **Sam Beckbessinger** was one of those attendees and the game’s co-creator, and is responsible for all of the bad jokes in this story.

This story is a work of fiction, but it is informed by real science. Over 25 scientists, researchers, policymakers and subject-matter experts were consulted in putting this story together. Sci-fi writers from Finland, India, Qatar and South Africa helped craft the storylines and come up with the hilarious headlines. You can find a full list of their names on [the credits page](endmatter_credits.html){:.show-page-number}.

## Why write a branching story about climate change?

Climate scientists are often pushed to the front of the climate movement. They were among the first to raise the alarm about what’s in store if we don’t slow down climate breakdown. Their cutting-edge predictions – ice melt, species extinctions, extreme drought and wildfires – are the best way to communicate what’s really at stake, so the theory goes.

But sometimes, the sophisticated computer models climate scientists create are an insufficient guide.

## Stories are powerful

The possible climate futures that await us will be a big, complex mess of political and social forces interacting with environmental change. That's hard to model. Of course, we still need excellent scientific models to help us understand what the future of the planet might look like. But we also need other tools.

This is where fiction comes in. In recent years, we’ve seen the rise of climate fiction, or ‘cli-fi’ – a sub-genre of speculative fiction that tells the stories of what might be to come as our climate changes beyond recognition.

This book is an experiment in the power of fiction to help people vividly imagine a range of climate futures lying ahead.

Do you call school strikers heroes or hooligans? As the climate crisis displaces millions of people, do you back corporate visas, harsh refugee camps, or resettlement in richer countries? The story confronts the reality that all of us wield a certain kind of power – one that deals in stories, not the scientific method. And it brings to life the fact that the stories we tell to ourselves and others have very real consequences for the future.

## Beyond temperature

When the future of the planet is already so extraordinary, why turn to fiction?

First, it’s how humans work. We make sense of our past, present and future by telling each other stories: narratives with a beginning and end, and with something important at stake. That fills an emotional gap – engaging heart as well as head – that no amount of research evidence can. Stories allow us to feel ourselves in the future, not just think ourselves there.

Next, fiction can deal with complexity. The future consequences of climate change tend to be imagined around keeping global heating below certain temperature increase targets: 2°C, 3°C, 4°C. Science can give us some sense of the climate consequences of each – but too often, that means that we imagine a binary future where a 1.5°C rise is safe and everything else is hell.

But it’s not that simple, and that’s where fiction comes in. The game allows players to create a world with a stable climate that’s even more unjust than the one we live in now – or a fair world that’s unlivably hot.

One stream takes us down an ultra-capitalist route, where corporate visas control climate-driven migration and dictate global policy, and businesses exploit the fact that they own climate-ready technology. Such a future might end up being good in temperature terms, but raise challenges in terms of global equity. Another illustrates a future where a Global Climate Council becomes an authoritarian government, keeping warming to 1.5°C but crushing freedom in the process. Other choices build a healthier version of the world at that same temperature: where citizens are protected, democracy flourishes, and governments work together. This reminds us that there’s not a single good future and a single bad one: instead, there’s an infinite number of complex futures, and only we can control which we get.

## Adventure

Our game helps players understand that we can shape our future, not just witness it. For many, that feeling of power over climate change has been lost in recent years.

As climate activists saw inaction stall progress, many stopped hedging. They developed clear and unequivocal messages: if we don’t stop climate change right now, there is no future for us on this planet. It got people to understand the scale of the threat. But it also made some people believe there’s nothing they can do: this is the future of the planet and big international climate change meetings, they thought, something bigger than me, and where’s the point in trying to change that?

Fiction – and especially a branching narrative style – puts control in the hands of the reader. It reminds them that the important decisions are the ones that lie ahead of us, not behind us.

To take action on climate change, we have to know what science says is likely to happen. But we must also know what it might be like to feel the heat of an unprecedented bushfire on our skin, the spike of fear when multiple crops fail, or the relief of breathing cleaner air in greener cities, halting sea ice loss in the Arctic, and the joys of living in more equitable societies.

Facts keep us realistic. But to really believe them, we have to be willing to deal in fiction.
