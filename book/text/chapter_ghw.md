The rich have a point. By altering the economy in such fundamental ways, GDP really has dropped in many places.

Which is weird, because most people have seen a marked improvement in their quality of life.

So, obviously how weâ€™re measuring the economy is wrong!

The world stops focusing on stuff like [GDP](#infobox) and stock-market growth and starts focusing on a new, single GHW (global human welfare) score. This score measures the health, happiness, security and wellbeing of all humans around the world.

With this score, the proposed actions are predicted to dramatically improve the economy.

> Gross domestic product (GDP) is a tool for measuring the size and health of an economy. But this measure is imperfect, as it does not take into account whether our economies are environmentally sustainable, healthy or equal. Many countries with high GDPs are causing the most damage to our environment. For example, both Saudi Arabia and the United States are within the top ten highest-emitting countries worldwide and suffer from above-average levels of inequality. On paper, these countries would appear to be doing very well due to their high GDPs.
