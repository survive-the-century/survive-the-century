We deploy high-tech carbon removal technologies (literally giant machines that clear the air and ocean of global warming pollutants), and they’re a real help in stabilizing the climate.
{:.leader-sentence}

These machines are expensive, though. Activists point out that one way we could fund them would be to disband our militaries. The world has been a very peaceful place for decades, after all!

Should we disband our militaries?

> Carbon capture and storage technologies aim to remove carbon dioxide pollution from the air and store it where it can't re-enter the atmosphere, usually underground. Many of these technologies are still energy-intensive and expensive, and none are yet able to work at the large scales that would be needed to stabilize the climate.
