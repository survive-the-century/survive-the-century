*(Leaked transcript of video call between US Leader-for-Life and African president of the Free States)*

US President, **Barron Trump** (A dim tantalum bulb swings slowly above his head, ominously close. Shadows dance on the bare wall. The light goes off repeatedly and every time this happens, a secret service guy rushes in with a torch.)

African leader, **Virendra Xulu** (Dazzling backdrop of a solar farm stretching right up to the horizon. He seems to be floating on an infinity pool.)

Trump
: Hello, Chef! How you doin’? Hope you don’t mind me calling you Chef, Mr President of the Free States?

Xulu
: Howzit, Darren? Can’t see you clearly.

Trump
: That’s amazing! Know what, we had a little setback but are getting back into the electricity game. It will take a little more time and some help from friends while we sweep the States clear of hostile forces.

Xulu
: Good to hear that, Darren.

Trump
: Great, thanks, Chef. It’s Barron here. But coming back to business, you’ve done a classy job with the solars I’m told. And hey, I can see you’ve got a lot of water over there too.

Xulu
: Zilch! This pool is just holo-AR but the solars, yes. Those are real… I’m told.

Trump
: Secretary of Defence Maven tells me he has already informed you that we need that electricity you are pumping out from the sun. For our bioreactors, while agri gets back on its feet. We are going after the losers who engineered that blight.

Xulu
: Happy to help, but we will be left with no power if

Trump
: You have the crop fields and the elephants. Why do you need power? We can use it here for our all-American ThinAir process. My scientific adviser, Clara, tells me we got loads of the dioxide here… same carbon-fucking-dioxide… and the micro-bees; we only need your sun volts to manufacture our food.

Xulu
: Whoa! The bees? Hmm… but Barron, that tube you stuck into the Milky Way – that was what started all this trouble and the wars. My northern regions turned wasteland and the Sahara is still crawling southward…

Trump
: Let it crawl. It’s all China, so no harm done. It was the commies that started this business. Besides, you have enough sun over there; a little darkness at night is good rest for your eyes.

Xulu
: But the sulphur you are pumping up –

Trump
: Look here, Chef. You are a fantastic guy, I admire your leadership. But the Great Gustaff [SO<sub>2</sub> pipe] is non-negotiable. We can do some other deal… lemme see… I hear you don’t see any fish lately?

Xulu
: Ag, man, not a shoal in our oceans.

Trump
: Great. We can bring those back.

Xulu
: I always knew you were a witch-doctor, Darren, but if you take down the Gustaff

Trump
: We will vaporize those Mexican terror groups seeding the oceans and driving away the fish and you give us electricity.

Xulu
: Mexicans? Please don’t nuke ’em again…

Trump
: So it’s a done deal. Our floating Tesla towers will get your sun volts across the pond and you enjoy grilled snapper, like good ol’ days.

Xulu
: But Darren, Mr President, your people will get respite from the acid showers if you bring down that tube of yours!

Trump
: I will tweet that out, professor. Meanwhile enjoy the sun while you have it!
