Doesn’t it make more sense for the government to just give people cash and let them spend it how they want to? 
{:.leader-sentence}

Governments tend to be less efficient than specialists. So we should leave education to the education experts, and healthcare to the healthcare experts!

We dramatically de-fund healthcare, education, energy and other social services and lower taxes, instead giving every citizen cash every month. There’s a boom in new businesses that pop up to offer these services, but the quality is variable.

Climate change is still a worry, but governments don’t have a lot of money left to fix the problem directly.
