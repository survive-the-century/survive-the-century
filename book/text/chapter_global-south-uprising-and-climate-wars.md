The world has been far too busy worrying about war to do much about climate change. It's getting hotter, which means more droughts, more hurricanes, and more wildfires. The worst impacts are happening in poor countries.
{:.leader-sentence}

The leaders of 50 countries in the Global South (low-income countries) band together and say *enough*. Stop bickering! We have to stop all emissions within the next 15&nbsp;years, and urgently try to reverse the damage that’s already been done. Rich countries, who've caused most of the damage, need to pay to help low-income countries adapt to the changed climate.

Most of your readers live in rich countries. Will you encourage them to take responsibility and get serious about reversing the damage we’ve done to the planet?
