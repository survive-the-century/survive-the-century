The world is now capturing more greenhouse gases than it produces, but we’re still recovering from damage that was done to the environment earlier in the century.

In 2062, we get unlucky. Hot oceans lead to a series of terrible hurricanes across the southern US and Caribbean, destroying thousands of homes and ripping up forests.

We’re already capturing a lot of greenhouse gases through natural methods like planting trees and preserving wild areas, but some groups say we need to speed things up with high-tech carbon removal technology.

What do you think we should do?

> If we were to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions to zero in 2021, temperatures would probably stabilize within the next 10 to 30 years. But some parts of the climate system respond much more slowly than temperatures. Sea levels would still rise for the rest of the century because past greenhouse gas emissions have "locked-in" an amount of glacier and ice sheet melting. That doesn’t mean our actions don’t matter: every 0.1 of a degree of extra warming translates into more lives lost and more species extinct.
