Climate rebels around the world start implementing small-scale projects to hack the climate. 
{:.leader-sentence}

These projects somewhat work, but have unintended consequences. Communities have to adapt to a lot of sudden weather changes: areas that had a lot of rainfall suddenly have to cope with droughts; cities that had become more resilient against droughts suddenly have to deal with flooding.

The world erupts in a series of violent local conflicts over suddenly scarce resources. You publish a report saying that three-quarters of the people in the world now live in countries experiencing civil wars.

The effects are terrible. Millions starve. Billions are displaced by war. This decade is called “the terrible 70s”.
