Climate rebels around the world start implementing small-scale projects to hack the climate. 
{:.leader-sentence}

These projects somewhat work, but they are being used at a time when there is already massive disruption to weather systems. Thanks to climate change, communities have had to adapt to a lot of sudden weather changes: areas that had a lot of rainfall suddenly have to cope with droughts; cities that had become more resilient against droughts suddenly have to deal with flooding. Now, with climate hacking projects, nobody is sure just who or what is responsible when something bad happens.

Overall, the temperature of the planet doesn’t increase as much as it might have, but the disruption to people’s lives is arguably higher.
