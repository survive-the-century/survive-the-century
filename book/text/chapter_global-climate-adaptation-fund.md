Although they say they can't reduce their own emissions faster, they do contribute trillions of dollars to a global climate fund.

This fund is used to research and deploy technology that will help to stabilize the climate, and to help poorer countries adapt to more extreme weather events.

> The Green Climate Fund was set up after the Copenhagen climate negotiations in 2009. It is supposed to support the efforts of developing countries in responding to the challenges of climate change. So far, rich countries have failed to meet their promises and [given much less money to the fund](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/10/25/green-climate-fund-replenishment-fails-fill-hole-left-trumps-us/) than they said they would, but there is hope that this might change as citizens put pressure on their leaders to do more about climate change.
