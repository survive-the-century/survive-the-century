A poll indicates that an overwhelming 80 per cent of people believe that climate projects should be managed democratically.

A new generation of bold young politicians begin to speak out publicly about this issue. They try to pass laws nationalizing climate projects, or at least requiring them to follow some rules.

But after decades of pandering to the interests of private businesses, the government just doesn’t have the power to force private companies to do anything anymore.

Corporations don’t just run climate projects; they also control schools, private militaries, the healthcare system, and the entire financial system. They threaten to pull funding from climate projects completely if politicians keep pushing for nationalization.

Activists back down and nothing really changes.

Runaway effects of the climate hacks devastate parts of the world, forcing the last remaining free societies into corporate cities, where they hope to “earn” citizenship through work… maybe. One day. The unluckiest are forced into jobs on the nascent Mars colony.
