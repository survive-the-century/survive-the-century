Each rich country agrees to contribute ten per cent of its GDP to a global climate transition fund.
{:.leader-sentence}

This money is spent to build infrastructure to help cities ravaged by climate change adapt to extreme weather, to invest in food security, and to pay compensation to countries that have already suffered the most from global warming. We also invest in researching technological ways that could reduce global warming.

Most countries that did not already offer a universal basic income (UBI) now introduce them.

Quality of life improves rapidly for most people in the world.

If you don't already have one, award yourself the UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME badge!
