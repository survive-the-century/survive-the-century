# So, where do we end up by the end of the century?

So close, and yet so far!
{:.leader-sentence}

We will remember this as the century when we stopped prioritizing growth above all else, and started valuing the truly valuable things: human welfare and the environment. Nature is thriving and species we thought were extinct recover, while new species have evolved for the new wild places of the earth.

But then we lost it all to rich Martians.

# How did you get here?

You focused on reducing emissions early in the century, took bold steps to build a more inclusive economy, and prioritized respect for the natural world. Unfortunately, you had no ability to protect the earth youâ€™d built from people who wanted to take it for themselves.
