We start to see a lot of experiments in new forms of communal and sustainable urban living, as people are freed from constant worry about their next pay cheque.

We start reforming capitalism with new rules like employee representation on boards. The gap between rich and poor closes.

A lot of renewable energy projects happen on a grassroots level as co-operatives and community-owned projects. It looks like the world is on track to reach zero emissions by 2037.

But wait, the rich have \#sadfeels about all this! They produce charts proving that all this equality will decimate the world’s economy!
