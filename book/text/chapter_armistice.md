Peace is declared.
{:.leader-sentence}

After a decade of fighting, society is exhausted. Weâ€™re ready to do whatever it takes to ensure that war never breaks out again.

We strengthen our commitments to the United Nations. Countries that left it in a huff over the past few decades re-join.

The UN is given new powers. Their first goal is to rebalance the climate, because we recognize that climate change was a major part of inflaming conflict.

The UN launches a number of geoengineering projects, including a fleet of satellites in space that reflect sunlight away.

Society has invested billions into their militaries. We decide to retrain and repurpose them for huge new projects to restore the environment and act as an international disaster response team.
