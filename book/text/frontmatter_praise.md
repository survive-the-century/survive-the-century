# Praise for *Survive the Century*

“A sneaky-simple game that makes our climate choices real.” - Brain Kahn, *Gizmodo*

“A climate fiction game where your choices on what narratives are highlighted will determine how well humanity will survive the 21st century.” - Fridays for Future

“Laden with smart quips, tragic and hilarious narrative forks, and cute illustrations, and with its lengthy list credits (including artists, scientists, and backers), it’s a lesson in what can be achieved through collaboration... you know, the sort we’re going to need to keep average global temperatures down and our grandkids’ odds of survival up.”- Craig Wilson, *Input Mag*

“One thing I really liked about the game was how much of a holistic approach it took. You had to balance all of these different factors - climate, conflict, and the economy.” - Forrest Brown, *Stories for Earth*

“The game prompts players to seriously contemplate challenging questions about how we can reach a balance between nature and ourselves.” - *The Optimist Daily*

“Smart, even tragic at times, while offering an important lesson.” - Medha Dutta Yadav, *New Indian Express*

“Although the scenarios players encounter in the game are fictional — developed by a group of science-fiction writers — the creators collaborated with scientists to ensure the trajectories were possible within the bounds of time and warming.” - Katelyn Weisbrod, *Inside Climate News*

“For those who feel despondent and like it's too late for us to do anything, go play *Survive the Century* and see that there are actually options.” - Tamara Oberholster, independent journalist

"A journey through the forking paths of policy choice and consequent scenarios juiced up with hilarious, satirical and irreverent stories." - Rajat Chaudhuri, *Telegraph India*
